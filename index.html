                            I am an energetic, hardworking, and ambitious individual who has developed a mature and
                            responsible approach
                            to any task or situation that I am presented with. I excel at collaborating with others to
                            achieve a specific goal
                            on time and with excellence. I am always eager to learn and share my knowledge. Throughout
                            my successful
                            restaurant career and weThinkCode journey, I have developed exceptional team leadership,
                            planning, and
                            organizing skills. I am an articulate, confident individual who enjoys challenges and
                            working under pressure. I
                            am good at time management and multitasking. I am used to working in a stressful
                            environment, especially when
                            dealing with multiple projects and priorities at once.
